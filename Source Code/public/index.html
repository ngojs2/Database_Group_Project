        <h2>Welcome to Bits N Bytes</h2>
        <p>
            “Bits N Bytes” is a store with multiple locations and online that sells electronics. Some of the electronics it sells include computers, accessories, cameras, phones, gadgets, and other gizmos. 
            Originally a storefront with locations around the US, it recently opened an online store to serve customers worldwide. In order to keep track of the sales of both its physical storefronts and the online store, 
            a database driven website will help record Sales Orders of Products to Customers. Having these sales records in one database will help the company analyze which products sell the most/ sell the least and the overall total sales performance for both store types.
